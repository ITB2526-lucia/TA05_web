    <h2 class="project-title">Virtualized Environment with Proxmox and Active Directory</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        This project consists of creating a complete virtualized environment using Proxmox as the hypervisor.
        The goal was to design a flexible, scalable, and secure infrastructure that would allow the management
        of virtual machines, the implementation of an Active Directory domain, and the simulation of a real
        business environment.
    </p>

    <img src="../../img/2thumb.jpg" alt="Proxmox Environment" class="project-image">

    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Project Objectives</h3>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        The project focused on building a professional environment that would allow:
    </p>

    <ul class="project-list">
        <li>Managing virtual machines from a single centralized panel.</li>
        <li>Implementing a functional Active Directory domain.</li>
        <li>Creating Group Policies (GPO) for users and computers.</li>
        <li>Configuring segmented internal networks to improve security.</li>
        <li>Simulating a real business environment with Windows clients and Linux servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="project-subtitle">System Architecture</h3>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        The system is based on a Proxmox server hosting several virtual machines. Among them:
    </p>

    <ul class="project-list">
        <li>A Windows Server domain controller.</li>
        <li>Windows 10 clients joined to the domain.</li>
        <li>Linux servers for testing and additional services.</li>
        <li>Separate internal networks for management, users, and services.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        This architecture allows service isolation, improved security, and easier environment administration.
    </p>

    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Active Directory and Group Policies</h3>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        A complete domain was configured with users, groups, and security policies. GPOs allow control over
        key configurations within the network, such as:
    </p>

    <ul class="project-list">
        <li>Access restrictions and permissions.</li>
        <li>Automatic software installation.</li>
        <li>Network drive mapping.</li>
        <li>Desktop configuration and security directives.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        Thanks to these policies, the environment behaves like a real business network, with centralized control
        and efficient management of users and devices.
    </p>

    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Technologies Used</h3>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        To carry out this project, various tools and technologies were used to build a professional and scalable
        virtualized environment. Among them:
    </p>

    <ul class="project-list">
        <li>Proxmox VE as the main hypervisor.</li>
        <li>Windows Server for Active Directory implementation.</li>
        <li>Windows 10 as domain-joined clients.</li>
        <li>Linux distributions for additional services and testing.</li>
        <li>Internal virtual networks and bridges configured in Proxmox.</li>
        <li>GPO for centralized management of users and devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="project-subtitle">Conclusions</h3>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        This project allowed me to deeply understand how a real business environment works,
        from virtual machine management to user administration through Active Directory.
        It also strengthened my knowledge in networking, security, and virtualization, and gave me practical
        experience in creating scalable and well-organized infrastructures.
    </p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
        Thanks to this environment, I was able to simulate real situations, apply security policies, automate
        configurations, and work with different operating systems in an integrated way. It is a project that
        reflects my ability to design, implement, and manage complex systems.
